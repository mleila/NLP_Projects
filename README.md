# NLP_Projects
List of personal projects related to NLP.

1. [AGNews_Document_Classifcation](https://github.com/mleila/AGNews_Document_Classifcation) explores how to build a system to assign categories to news headlines. This is a relatively simple multi-class classification problem, however, it requires the development of a decent text processing pipeline. I find the abstractions developed in this project, such as `Vectorizer` and `Vocabulary` classes, to be of practical use.
2. [Machine Translation System](https://github.com/mleila/machine_translation) explores how to build an end-to-end machine translation system.
